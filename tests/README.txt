These are the tests for the Glob library by Matti Niemenmaa, and should reside
in a subdirectory of the Glob distribution.

To run the tests, run 'Main.hs'.

You'll need the following packages:

  base                      >= 3.* && < 5
, Glob                      == 0.*
, filepath                  == 1.*
, HUnit                     == 1.2.*
, QuickCheck                >= 1.1 && < 2
, test-framework            >= 0.2 && < 1
