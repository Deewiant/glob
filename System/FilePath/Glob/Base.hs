-- if the uppercase characters are consecutive, so are the lowercase.
--
-- 1) might be feasible if someone bothered to get the latest data.
--
-- 2) obviously isn't since you might have 'Right (minBound, maxBound)' in
-- there somewhere.

-- COMPILATION
------------------------------------------


-- |Compiles a glob pattern from its textual representation into a 'Pattern'
-- object.
--
-- For the most part, a character matches itself. Recognized operators are as
-- follows:
--
-- [@?@]      Matches any character except path separators.
--
-- [@*@]      Matches any number of characters except path separators,
--            including the empty string.
--
-- [@[..\]@]  Matches any of the enclosed characters. Ranges of characters can
--            be specified by separating the endpoints with a @\'-'@. @\'-'@ or
--            @']'@ can be matched by including them as the first character(s)
--            in the list. Never matches path separators: @[\/]@ matches
--            nothing at all. Named character classes can also be matched:
--            @[:x:]@ within @[]@ specifies the class named @x@, which matches
--            certain predefined characters. See below for a full list.
--
-- [@[^..\]@ or @[!..\]@] Like @[..]@, but matches any character /not/ listed.
--                        Note that @[^-x]@ is not the inverse of @[-x]@, but
--                        the range @[^-x]@.
--
-- [@\<m-n>@] Matches any integer in the range m to n, inclusive. The range may
--            be open-ended by leaving out either number: @\"\<->\"@, for
--            instance, matches any integer.
--
-- [@**/@]    Matches any number of characters, including path separators,
--            excluding the empty string.
--
-- Supported character classes:
--
-- [@[:alnum:\]@]  Equivalent to @\"0-9A-Za-z\"@.
--
-- [@[:alpha:\]@]  Equivalent to @\"A-Za-z\"@.
--
-- [@[:blank:\]@]  Equivalent to @\"\\t \"@.
--
-- [@[:cntrl:\]@]  Equivalent to @\"\\0-\\x1f\\x7f\"@.
--
-- [@[:digit:\]@]  Equivalent to @\"0-9\"@.
--
-- [@[:graph:\]@]  Equivalent to @\"!-~\"@.
--
-- [@[:lower:\]@]  Equivalent to @\"a-z\"@.
--
-- [@[:print:\]@]  Equivalent to @\" -~\"@.
--
-- [@[:punct:\]@]  Equivalent to @\"!-\/:-\@[-`{-~\"@.
--
-- [@[:space:\]@]  Equivalent to @\"\\t-\\r \"@.
--
-- [@[:upper:\]@]  Equivalent to @\"A-Z\"@.
--
-- [@[:xdigit:\]@] Equivalent to @\"0-9A-Fa-f\"@.
--
-- Note that path separators (typically @\'/\'@) have to be matched explicitly
-- or using the @**/@ pattern. In addition, extension separators (typically
-- @\'.\'@) have to be matched explicitly at the beginning of the pattern or
-- after any path separator.
--
-- If a system supports multiple path separators, any one of them will match
-- any of them. For instance, on Windows, @\'/\'@ will match itself as well as
-- @\'\\\'@.
--
-- Error recovery will be performed: erroneous operators will not be considered
-- operators, but matched as literal strings. Such operators include:
--
-- * An empty @[]@ or @[^]@ or @[!]@
--
-- * A @[@ or @\<@ without a matching @]@ or @>@
--
-- * A malformed @\<>@: e.g. nonnumeric characters or no hyphen
--
-- So, e.g. @[]@ will match the string @\"[]\"@.
