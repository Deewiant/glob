0.4, 2009-??-??:
	New function:
		System.FilePath.Glob.factorPath :: Pattern -> (FilePath, Pattern)

	Change: ".." can now be matched, by patterns such as ".*".
	Change: globDir, given "" as the directory, uses getCurrentDirectory.

	Bug fix: globDir doesn't convert patterns like "a./b" to "ab".
	Bug fix: the Show instance used to show "[?]" as the very different "?" (and
	         a few similar cases).
	Bug fix: "//./" wasn't getting optimized properly.
	Bug fix: ".//a" matched "/a".

0.3.2, 2008-12-20:
	Regression fix: handle directories without read permissions properly.

	Convenience for developers: -XTemplateHaskell no longer barfs on
	Compile.hs.
